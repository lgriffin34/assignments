Headline: Shofuso Japanese House and Garden: A Cultural Space for Reflection, Relaxation, and Remembrance

Content: Shofuso Japanese House and Garden is a traditional 17th century style Japanese guesthouse surrounded by three different styles of Japanese garden. After being on display for an exhibit at the MoMA, it moved to Fairmount Park in 1958. It is a space to relax and take in the view, learn more about Japanese architecture and history, and to participate in cultural events and festivals year-round. I also work here! Come visit me, and I will let you in for free. It's a beautiful place, and since moving to Philadelphia a little over a year ago this space has helped me create a community.
